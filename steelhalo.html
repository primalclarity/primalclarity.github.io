         <h2>Steel Halo – Commons League</h2>
         <img src="images/banner2.jpg" alt="Steel Halo" />
<p>Steel Halo is the rumoured sport played by the Huristar, the legendary Holy Guard of the
Emperor. Named in honour of Emperor Zaquen, known to citizens of the Empire as the Steel Halo,
the brutal contact sport has gradually filtered through to the outer rim colonies, spread by disgraced
Huristar trying to relive their former glory.</p>
<p>Competitors form teams and use a variety of Gravity Rifles to vie for possession of the crown, which
must be shot through a goal to score. There are no rules, no penalties, no umpires – the highest
score wins.</p>
